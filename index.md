### Deep Learning Methods
There is an abundant amount of great knowledge about deep learning I have learned via studying, self-learning and research.
So all methods below can be applied to most major deep learning architectures

```markdown

- Back-Propagation
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Learning Rate Decay
- Dropout
- Max Pooling
- Batch Normalization
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Skip-gram
- Continuous Bag Of Words
- Transfer Learning

```
